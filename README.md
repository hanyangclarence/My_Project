# Attempt 14: Rerun 3.4 with new conditioning module
    
    failed in text 2 music motion

    motion 2 music:
    The result is really not good, but seems that there's a potential?

## Attempt 14.2: Give higher weight to music
Change motion weight from 0.5 to 0.3

Some of the results are audible, but most are not!


## Attempt14.3: Add a trainable bias for music2motion attention
